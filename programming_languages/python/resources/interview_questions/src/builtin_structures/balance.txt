This is the classic "you have 8 balls/coins, which are the same weight, except for one which is slightly heavier than the others. You also have an old-style balance. What is the fewest number of weighings to find the heavy coin/ball?

Answer: 2! You need to use every information available:
Weight 3 x 3 balls/coins.
If they weight the same: weight the 2 balls/coins left outside.
Else, measure 2 of the 3 heavier balls/coins.
