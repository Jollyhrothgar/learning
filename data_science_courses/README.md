# Introduction

I paid for the [python for data science and machine learning
bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)
course ($12.00) and it was great early in my career. I strongly recommend it.

I had originally cloned a bunch of code I didn't write, but the course now has
an updated github that I can use, so I killed all my notes because they were
probably out of date and not adding much anyway.
