# Jupyter Notebok Tips and Tricks

A few (hopefully) useful tips and tricks to using the Jupyter Notebook to its full potential. This is not, in any way, an exhaustive demostration of the Jupyter notebook. Quite a bit of the information is given verbally as I generally give a demonstration of these notebooks.

If you have any suggestions, edits, or corrections, please open an issue or let me know some other way. Best of luck!
