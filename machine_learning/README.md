# Introduction

This "machine learning" portion of my learning has undergone some of the most
extensive deletions. I used to have other repositories in here (some written in
Matlab, LOL!) which were just not relevant or reflective of any work I had done.

I removed all the stuff that was basically just boilerplate sklearn, because I
now know how to use the internet to find this stuff. The most active area here
is really the section on [Deep Learning](./deep_learning/README.md).
