# About

This repository represents my self-study learning about machine learning, and
deep learning in general. I will be working through the following materials:

* Basics of deep learning: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/
* Manifold hypothesis: http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/
* Unsupervised learning with generative adversarial networks: https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code
* Unsupervised learning with generative adversarial networks applied to NLP: http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/
* A study of bias-varience tradeoff and cross-validation
* Read through a PhD thesis:  http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~dduvenaud/thesis.pdf

Although I have some experience with 'deep learning', with maximum likelihood
selection, I don't have much experience with neural networks, or formal
educaiton in deep learning. Just what I've encountered over the course of
earning my PhD in physics.
