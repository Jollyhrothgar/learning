# Software Engineering

This repository contains all my study and practice preparing to transition to
the Google SWE ladder. Maybe someday I will open this repository up to the
public, but for now, its private.

Engineers are evaluated along the following:

*   Does the candiate listen carefully and comprehend the question?
*   Are the correct questions asked before proceeding? (important)
*   Is brute force used to solve a problem? (bad sign)
*   Are things assumed without checking? (bad sign)
*   Did the candidate identify all the corner and edge cases? (important)
*   Did the candidate solve the question quickly in order to leave room for
    additional problems? (very important)

Solutions should be:

*   Efficient
*   Optimized
*   Readable
*     High Quality
