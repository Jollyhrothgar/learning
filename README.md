# Introduction

I've merged a lot of my work over the past years into one "learning" repository
focused on, you guessed it, learning. 

When I originally created this repository in 2016, it was primarily used as a
dumping ground for random classes that I wanted to take, but never found the
time, interview prep for data science and machine learning roles, and literally
copies of other repositories that looked useful, but that I never ended up using
(and would now be hopelessly out of date).

I also wanted to remove stuff that is interview prep focused, because honestly,
its different from learning, and I want this learning repository to grow beyond
just a interview prep repository. One potentially cool outcome of focusing this
repository on learning is that it could turn into some kind of online course
later.

Additionally, I think this repository should reflect stuff that I actually
generate, and now that I now how write proper markdown note-sheets, I can just
move all the repositories that I n00bishly forked into this repo into
cheatsheets that link to the original.
