# Introduction

This repository contains much of my work learning to program, learning about
machine learning and data science. It is reserved exclusively for small demos, 
little tutorials, and the like.

Some of the work is very old, and was just put here for me to chuckle at and see
how far I've come (check out the cpp area...cobwebs...).

Any little thing that I do, which might be useful as a reference, or a toy 
implementation which I might benefit from actually saving will go here. Proper 
projects will get their own repositories.

The goal of this repository is to reign in my learning into one place, to 
facilitate working on various machines without worring about synching things up.

This repository will also serve as a complete record/prep area for all job related
activities that I undertake over my career in Data Scienece / Machine learning.

In the Introduction.ipynb, the goal will be to link any relevant notebooks to 
concepts, notes, etc, elsewhere in this repo. The introduction ranks my comfort
level in these topics, but the ranking was carried out some time ago and is
not really relevant anymore.

Topics (overall) will be rated with a score (1, 2, or 3), where 3 is "very
prepared", 2 is "familiar, needs study" and 3 is "not at all prepared".
