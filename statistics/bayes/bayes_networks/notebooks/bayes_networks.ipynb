Therefore, we must come up with a means of constraining the values of B which admit the known data. The transition probabilities are unknown, but from the data, it seems that the outcome of C is highly correllated to the outcome A. Therefore, B must be correllated to A or C, or anit-correlated to A or C. However, the correlation between A and C is not perfect, as there is one case (3) which is not correlated to the others.\n",
